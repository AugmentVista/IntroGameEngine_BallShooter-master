I didn't begin any of the level designs with any grand scheme, 
which is unusal for me. Most cases I have a dozen ideas that are
all far beyond the scope of whatever I am doing and end up drowning
in the process to simplify an unrealistic aspiration. 
With this I didn't, I just started building something and testing it
as i went along. I had used some colors for color coding the levels
to determine which scene they belonged to based on difficulty. 
I don't know how to create a default probuilder material and they go
pink when i delete the textures so I hope this isn't rough on the eyes.
I plan to investigate this approach to design based on feedback I 
get on this project, if just going at something rather than trying
to plan its entire existance prior is a better approach.
